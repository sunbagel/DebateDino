## What is DebateDino?
DebateDino is a centralized platform that connects debate tournament organizers with its participants. Today's debate tournaments can be a logistical mess to manage. Teams register through Google Forms (often several) and payment is done through e-transfer.
Tournament organizers have to manage the information of hundreds of registrants, keeping track of which teams have signed up and the number of people who have paid.

With DebateDino, participants have a centralized hub where they can view and register for tournaments. Organizers can neatly keep track of data and handle payments all in one place.
